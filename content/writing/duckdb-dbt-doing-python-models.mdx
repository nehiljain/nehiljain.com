My transformation logic in a data pipeline in dbt required, dynamically generating regex based on another column. My intuition was, its a simple pandas apply with lambda function to get the value out of the other col; but in SQL damn hard.

I have been playing with DuckDB rececntly. So, I built my first dbt python model with duchdb adapter. I had a small [issue](https://github.com/duckdb/dbt-duckdb/issues/330) which got resolved super quickly thanks to [Josh Wills](https://twitter.com/josh_wills).

Simply install all the dependencies in your virtualenv where you run dbt. Use [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/python-models) to write the file with `model()` returning a single dataframe and you are done.

ðŸ’¡: You can build dbt pipelines in a box using duckdb excel plugin which can help you connect dbt to excel and gsheet. This can be powerful to convert current setups of non-tech data people into analytics engineers.
