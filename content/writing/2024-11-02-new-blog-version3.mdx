Inspired by Benn's "Just Do It," I transitioned from Obsidian + Digital Garden to a Next.js MDX blog. Why? Because sometimes you need to leap and trust the AI to catch you. It's like swapping old sneakers for rocket boots. ðŸš€

## The Magic of My New Setup

### Hero Section

A grand entrance with a background image and a circular profile pic that screams, "Hello, I'm Nehil Jain ðŸ‘‹, the tech wizard you seek."

### Projects Showcase

Interactive elements that feel like a tech carnival, showcasing AI-powered projects like ProoferX and LazyPMs.

### Embedded YouTube Videos

Who reads when you can watch? It's like having a personal cinema on your blog.

### Social Media Testimonials

If it's on Twitter, it must be true. My blog is now a shrine of digital praise.

### Insightful Callouts

Highlighting my genius thoughts with the subtlety of a neon sign.

## Building the Blog

### Choosing the Stack

I opted for Next.js with MDX for its flexibility and power. MDX allows me to embed custom React components directly in my posts, making the content dynamic and interactive.

### Deployment

The blog is deployed on Vercel, ensuring fast load times and seamless integration with Next.js features.

### Styling

I use styled-components for custom styling, avoiding bulky libraries like Bootstrap. This keeps the design clean and unique.

### Animation

Framer Motion brings life to the blog with smooth animations, enhancing user engagement.

### Backend

While mostly static, the blog uses Next.js API Routes for dynamic features like hit counters and likes, stored in a MongoDB database.

## Lessons Learned

This journey has been a wild ride, filled with laughter, memes, and the occasional facepalm. But as Benn would say, sometimes you just have to do it. So here I am, embracing the chaos and loving every minute of it. ðŸ˜‚

## Future Plans

I plan to explore more interactive elements and possibly integrate a newsletter for regular updates. The blog is a living project, and I'm excited to see where it goes next.
