All the tools [buffer](https://publish.buffer.com/), [tweethunter](https://tweethunter.io/), [hyperfury](https://hypefury.com/) charge money to generate tweets. 

I had an itch to try running local llms and play with it.

I had also been re-reading [Content OS](https://www.justinwelsh.me/content-os) by Justin Welsh. He talks about generating content with various perspective about the same content. So I thought, I can automate a bunch of it by using prompt templates, inspiration tweet examples and mistral 7B.

#### Packages & Tooling:
- Vanilla Python
- notion-sdk-py
- LlamaIndex
- Ollama
- Mistral 7B


- [ ] #### Logic workflow

Code is at https://github.com/nehiljain/tweet-automation

#### Quick Introspection:
- Coding difficulty: Low
- Time to develop end to end: 6 hr for V1
- Usefulness: Instantly I was able to schedule 5 tweets in 15 mins
- Enjoyment: Felt great playing with Notion, Ollama, Obsidian
