I love working in #cli a lot. There is a common task of running daemon processes and then killing them at later stage.

Nowadays, I am building a project with dagster. I have been running Dagster locally, as documented at [docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/servi…](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/service).

Let’s say I want to kill the running dagster webserver:

### Old Tedious Process:

1. `ps -ef | grep dagster-webserver`
    
2. `kill -9 PID`
    

### New Process:

1. `pkill -SIGTERM -f dagster-webserver`
