Snowflake has revamped how companies use their data in the last 5 yrs.

Snowflake is a cloud data warehouse (CDW). It is designed from the ground up to perform big data analytics in the cloud.

I have been fortunate to follow the journey of modern data stack for the past 8 years and have learnt a ton from the community. I wanted to share my perspective on what are game-changing innovations to track for the next few years. This will help you open the door for new business opportunities.

Now, let's dive in.

## Clean rooms will unlock shared data analysis without the associated risks and costs.

This is a brand new innovation that allows companies to do analytics on combined data without actually sharing the data.

As the world puts more emphasis on the privacy of their data, removing various key attributes of a dataset, renders it useless for analysis. CDWs can now enable providers to share functions and data while abiding by HIPAA, GDPR, etc. Using clean rooms companies can generate granular and timely analytics to stay competitive in the current market.

## Snowpark consolidates more business logic to run in CDW. 

Another new capability of Snowflake is to allow developers to write their own code in their language of choice to execute data computations directly.

For the past 5 years, snowflake workloads have been primarily expressed in SQL. This was the reason why a lot of predictive analytics and data exploration was done in notebooks or other environments suitable for the developers. Snowpark unlocks the simplicity and speed of snowflake for complex workloads with minimal data movement. This drastically simplifies the architecture required to do both descriptive and predictive analytics.

## Data delivery will enable rapid app development on CDW. 

To build data apps, application developers have to move data out of CDW.

CDWs are OLAP systems that are optimized for processing big data and not high concurrency reads at low latency. This is going to change as snowflake delivers features that enable application development directly on top of it. This is yet to be released and I am waiting to see how that shapes out to be.

## Basically, Cloud is revolutionizing what is possible.

I am excited for the future of the data platform industry and how it unlocks self-serve data analytics and scalable data app development.
