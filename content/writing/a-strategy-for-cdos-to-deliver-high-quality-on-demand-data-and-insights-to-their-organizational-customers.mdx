Your data consumers, internal and external stakeholders, never get the data they need, when they need it. You thought migrating from a legacy data warehouse to Snowflake was enough! You are wrong.

While it is true that Snowflake propelled your team forward in delivering cheap and performant analytics, it is not enough.Â **What is holding you back are the methodologies that need to be migrated with your evolved data stack.**Â Data silo between database administrators/engineers and data consumers (data analysts and data scientists) in an anchor dragging your team.

High-functioning data teams are leapfrogging their productivity and impact with DataOps.

Clear examples of not realizing the full potential of your team and tools:

- Your Data scientists waste a lot of time waiting for the data.
    
- Your Data engineers spend long hours debugging and deploying pipelines.
    
- Data errors are a common cause of your costly business mistakes.
    

## The reason why your data team (DE, DS, DA) feels under-resourced and overwhelmed with requests is primarily lack of automation and collaboration.

These are the few challenges that burn your data team the most

- The data team is not able to cope with the business needs of insights and data assets.
    

- Data lives in silos and it takes a long complex process to get it in the hands of the data scientists and analysts.
    

- Errors in data cause costly downtime in data pipelines and slow down the development of new assets.
    
- Manual processes in data your teams strain their productivity and lead to high turnover.
    

## Adopt, DataOps: The set of guiding principles to deliver faster and higher quality data and insights to the right stakeholders.

DataOps is DevOps applied to the data lifecycle "Raw DataÂ [**ðŸ‘‰**](https://emojipedia.org/backhand-index-pointing-right/)Â Biz Insight".

This framework encourages the following:

- Analytics is code and configuration. They should be versioned and reviewed like software.
    
- Quality is paramount, use tests on data pipelines and monitor continuously using proper tooling.
    
- Reduced cost of experimentation by using Infrastructure as code. Let the data team create disposable environments.
    
- Orchestrating end-to-end is key.
    
- Breaking down barriers between D. Eng, D. Scientist, D. Analyst, and others.
    

Implementing these practices will minimize the time and effort to turn a customer's need into an analytic idea, create it in development, release it as a repeatable production process, and finally refactor and reuse that product.
