I am in the process of updating my file with the latest tools.

My instinct: #genai should do help me.

I asked GPT4 and Bard to critique my brewfile. Few observations:

1. GPT4 is definitely lazier as compared to Bard.
    
2. They were able to flag duplicate tools like `yadm` , `chezmoi` . Both manage dotfiles.
    
3. They highlighted which sections were strong and where additional tools would be good.

I usually fork popular Brewfiles to get my selection of the best apps. This has helped me get to the ideal state quickly.

[My Brewfile](https://github.com/nehiljain/dotfiles/blob/main/Brewfile) is on git.
